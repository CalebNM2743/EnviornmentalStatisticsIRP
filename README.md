# EnviornmentalStatisticsIRP
This is my Independent Research Project for Environmental Statistics. 

It is based on real-life data collected on the Prescott National Forest and
will ideally allow selection of species composition based on desired species.

This code will create a framework with which to gather data, then dissect it to
get composition, then apply it to a shapefile and plot it so that the
associated pastures display the composition the desired species has in that
pasture.
